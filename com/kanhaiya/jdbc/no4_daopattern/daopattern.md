## DAO pattern
### The DAO Pattern (Data Access Object Pattern) is a design pattern used in Java (and many other languages) to separate business logic from database access logic.

1. Separate DB logic from business logic
2. Make the code clean, modular, and maintainable
3. Make it easier to change database later without changing your main code
